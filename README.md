# Intelligent-Evaluation-System
A PyTorch-based Intelligent Evaluation System comparing the performance of RNN, LSTM, and GRU models on sequential data. The project aims to explore differences in memory mechanisms, training stability, and accuracy across various recurrent architectures for intelligent evaluation and prediction tasks.
